A simple Python code to convert ONNX file from a PT file (which generated if you use YOLO Computer Vision)

For visualization, I would prefer using ONNX file to put into `netrom.app` to see all the convolution step and how YOLO actually do their things, the PT file when uploading it to the website kinda dodgy (cause all I saw just data and results).
